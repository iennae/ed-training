## Team Activity 5

In pairs, discuss your current work environment. 

* Who are the members of your team (at work)?
* What version control system do you use?
* Who are the people who have commit access?
* What's the flow of code from design to deploy?

While one person shares their environment, the other person should draw a diagram to represent the information shared. Use circles to represent people, triangles to represent code repos, and rectangles to represent infrastructure. Use arrows to represent relationships and flow.

After this activity you should:

* From looking at your version control setup, understand the flow of access control.
* See where bottlenecks and improvements may be helpful.

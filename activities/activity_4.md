## Team Activity 4

Talk through workflow for tasks for your team. How will you figure out what work needs to be done, who will work on the work, and when it is done. Use postits to mock up a legend for types of work items. Use pad to mock up your work items board. Use blue tape to mark off lanes. 

* Discuss objectives.
* Describe work.
* Define lanes.
* Define a task.
* Define a project.

Kanban as a system is a visual process management tool that helps you to see:

* what to do
* when to do it
* how much of it to do

Kanban Principles

* Current process.
* Incremental, evolutionary change.
* Respects current processes, roles, responsibilities and titles.

Kanban Core Practices

* Visualize the work you do.
* Limit the amount of WIP.
* Manage the flow of work.
* Make policies explicit through documentation.
* Improve collaboratively.

Your states of work should reflect your current process, not the ideal process of what you want it to be. Incremental change can help you to get to a better set of processes and practices.

After this activity you should:

* Have an understanding of how to have this conversation with your own teammates.
* Built a primative kanban board.
* Know the fundamentals of kanban.

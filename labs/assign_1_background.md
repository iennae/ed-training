## Connect to Node 

SSH is a generic term used for the SSH protocol. ssh is the client command for connecting to remote nodes. sshd is the server program that runs on the remote node that must be up and running to allow for connections. 

ssh, Secure Shell is a way to connect to remote nodes. There are clients available on multiple operating systems. It is not a true shell like bash and tcsh. You need a username and password, or passphrase if using ssh keys.  

We have pre-established a privileged account on the remote node, and providing you with a username and password. When you use the ssh client, whether ssh on Mac or a GUI like putty on Windows, you are connecting to that node.

# Verify Local Environment

## Overview

In this exercise each participant configures and tests a local development environment.

## Connect to Node 

* ssh chef@NODE 

If you don't have ssh available please downlowd an ssh client. For Windows, a good option is [putty](http://www.putty.org/).


## Introduction to Git

## Customize your workstation (Everyone)

```
 $ git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
 $ git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS"

```

Example: 

```
$ git config --global user.name "Jennifer Davis"
$ git config --global user.email "sparklydevops@gmail.com"
```

## Verify .gitconfig creation

```
$ cat ~/.gitconfig
```

Example:

```
$ cat ~/.gitconfig
[user]
   name = Jennifer Davis
   email = sparklydevops@gmail.com
```

## Set your preferred git editor

* emacs
* nano
* vi/vim

```
$ git config --global core.editor EDITORNAME
```

## Create a Project Directory (Everyone)

* mkdir wd


* mkdir TEAM
* cd TEAM
* touch NAME
* git init
* git add .
* git commit -m "test git"
* git status

## Create a GitHub identity (Everyone)

* If you don't already have a github account, create one.
* Browse to http://github.com. Supply a username, email address, and password.
* Free plan is fine. Other plans allow you to have private repositories.

## (Optional) Setting up your Github keys

If you want to skip using your username and password each time, you can follow the steps here to set up your ssh keys:

https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/


## Share your GitHub identity with your group. 

## Provide GitHub identities to your instructors. (Notetaker)

* Jennifer Davis, iennae
* Katherine Daniels, kdaniels
 
## Accept invitation to GitHub JoeNGo Organization (Everyone)

Start on this step once your group's Notetaker has provided the GitHub identities for your group to your instructors.

* Visit https://github.com/JoeNGo
* Accept invitation.

## Verify access to repo. (Everyone)

### Create a Working Directory (wd)
* cd ~
* mkdir wd
* cd wd

### Clone the initial-git-test repo 

* git clone https://github.com/JoeNGo/initial-git-test.git
* cd initial-git-test
* git remote -v
* update README.md with your name and email address.
* git status

### Verify that you see that you have modifed README.md 

```
# On branch master
# Changed but not updated:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#  modified:   README.md
#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

```

* git add README.md
* git commit -m "added name"
* git status

### Verify that your local repo is ready to be pushed to the remote repo.

```
$ git status
# On branch master
# Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
#
nothing to commit (working directory clean)
```

* git push origin master

```
$ git push origin master

   9ebac23..b0fe04e  master -> master

```

If you run into conflict, pull updates, handle the conflicts, and resubmit edits.

* git pull origin master

Why could you have run into a conflict?

### Problems

* Are you getting an "Error: Permission to ORG/REPO denied to user" error?
 * Verify that you have been added to the organization to be able to write to repositories.

## Fork team repo (Everyone)

Fork your team's repo into your account, and clone it back to your workstation.
Replace "TEAM" with your TEAM's name. 

* From the GitHub GUI interface, click on your TEAM-repo 
* From the GitHub GUI interface, click on "Fork" and fork into your personal account.
* cd ~/wd
* git clone https://github.com/USER/TEAM-repo.git
* cd TEAM-repo
* git remote -v
* update README.md with your name and email address.
* git add README.md
* git commit -m "added name"
* git push origin master
* From the GitHub GUI interface, click on the pull request icon.
* Add an appropriate message and "Create pull request"
* Merge the pull request in to your project.

## Discuss and decide on a branching strategy. (Team discussion)

What is the process that you will handle collaboration and branching for your repo?

### Update docs (Notetaker)

* add notes taken during the team discussion to skills.md within the repo.
* update docs/branch.md with the team decided strategy
* update docs/nodes.md with the team's node IP addresses

## Outcome 

You should have an updated TEAM-repo with

* updated README with everyone from your team's name and email address
* forked remote TEAM-repo
* updated docs/branch.md, skills.md

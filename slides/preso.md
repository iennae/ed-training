## What is Devops

---

## What is Devops

Cultural movement that seeks to:

* change how individuals work,
* value the diversity of work done,
* develop conscious decisions in acceleration,
* plan for scale, and
* measure the effect of social and technical change.


^ J,K

---

# Folk Models

* general popularly understood meaning particular to a socio-cultural grouping but which has not been formally defined or standardized.

^ K

---

# Why Devops?

^ J,K

---

## High Performing Devops Teams
## are more agile
### 30X more frequent deployments
### 8000X faster lead times than peers

2014 PuppetLabs State of DevOps Survey

^ J

---

## High Performing Devops Teams
## are more reliable
### 2X change success rate
### 12X faster mean time to recovery (MTTR)

## Five Pillars of Effective Devops

* Collaboration
* Hiring
* Affinity
* Tools
* Scaling

^ K

---

# Collaboration

* Individuals Working Together

^ K

---

# Hiring

* Choosing Individuals

^ K

---

# Affinity

* From Individuals to Teams

^ K

---

# Tools

* Accelerators of Culture

^ K

---

# Scaling

* Evolution, growth and advancement of the organization

^ K Scaling is about the evolution, growth, and advancement of the organization as a whole; it is not limited to only discussions of increasing in size, but also about organizational change and development overall.

---

![fit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kdaniels/effective-devops/master/images/effectivedevops.jpg)

# Collaboration and Tools

^ J: Not enough time to cover all pillars. Not enough time to go into great depth which is why we are writing a book! We're going to focus on elements of collaboration and tools today.

---

## Recognizing your Devops Narrative

---


# The Devops Compact

* shared mutual understanding
* established boundaries

![fit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kdaniels/effective-devops/master/images/george.png)
![fit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kdaniels/effective-devops/master/images/general.png)

^ J,K: Book example (bad first, then good)

---

# Team

* Common purpose
* Defined beliefs
* Empowered

^ J

---

### Careless Conversations (inspired by Alan Cyment)

* Pair up
* Select one person to go first.
* For one minute, speaker talks about something passionate about. Listener stays seated, quiet, and acts disinterested.
* Switch roles and repeat.
* Repeat until both people have done this twice.

Time: 5 minutes

![fit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kdaniels/effective-devops/master/images/timer.png)

---

## Careless Conversations

* How does it feel not to be listened to?
* How does it feel to ignore someone?

---

## Cultivating Empathy

* Collect stories
* Listen
* Circle back

^ K: this is how you transform a group into a team

---

## Smarter Teams Build Better Value[^1]

* Lots of Communication
* Contribute equally to team's discussions
* Theory of Mind
* Increased diversity

[^1]: Engel, David et al. 'Reading The Mind In The Eyes Or Reading Between The Lines? Theory Of Mind Predicts Collective Intelligence Equally Well Online And Face-To-Face'. PLoS ONE 9.12 (2014): e115212. Web. 26 May 2015.

> A life becomes meaningful when one sees himself or herself as an actor within the context of a story.

-- George Howard

^ K: Work is meaningful when people see themselves as active participants. Sharing story is critical part of building resilience.

---

# Small vs Large teams

* Large teams - roles may be highly segregated
* Small teams - one person may be responsible for many roles

^ K

---

# Critical Habits for Teams

* Code Review
* Pairing

^ K

---

# Code Review

* Max 90 minutes in one setting

^ K

---

# Pairing

* Agile software development
* 2 people work together on 1 workstation
* Driver - writes code
* Observer - reviews each line
* Roles switch frequently

^ J

---

# Types of Pairing

* Expert-expert
* Expert-novice
* Novice-novice

^ J

^ When experts pair, work gets done quickly, new innovation not always obtained, depending on skill overlap because not questioning accepted standards of doing things.

^ When expert and novice pair, can be very good or very bad. if expert isn't patient and does all the typing, novice learns helplessness and slow to get anything done. if expert is patient can involve growth for both as novice helps expert to question standards.

^ When novices pair, can work together to learn and achieve more than a novice working on their own. If no understanding in pair, and fire-fighting schedules can lead to poor practices implemented into production higher technical debt.

^ J

---

* Non planned work that comes in
 * customer request
 * incident
 * request for help from coworker
 * single point of knowledge (you) work

^ J

---

# Blocked work

* Work that can progress no further:
 * dependent teams - blocked by external team
 * insufficiently qualified request - blocked by requester
 * dependent on SPOK - blocked by team
 * time dependent

^ J

---

# Team Exercise

Discuss with your team:

* What is the difference between a task and a project?
* Do you have interrupts? What are they?
* How do you determine when work is done?

Time: 15 minutes

# Impact of Change

## Impact on Availability
* Overall site/app availability
* Individual service availability

---

## Availability Monitoring
* Uptime:
* Pingdom, Monitis, Uptrends, etc
* Vertical Line Technology:
* Availability after deploys/changes

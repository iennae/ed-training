## What is Devops

---

## What is Devops

Cultural movement that seeks to:

* change how individuals work,
* value the diversity of work done,
* develop conscious decisions in acceleration,
* plan for scale, and
* measure the effect of social and technical change.

---

# Folk Models

* general popularly understood meaning particular to a socio-cultural grouping but which has not been formally defined or standardized.



---

# Why Devops?



---

## High Performing Devops Teams
## are more agile
### 30X more frequent deployments
### 8000X faster lead times than peers

2014 PuppetLabs State of DevOps Survey



---

## High Performing Devops Teams
## are more reliable
### 2X change success rate
### 12X faster mean time to recovery (MTTR)

# Foundation of DevOps


---

# Collaboration

> Individuals working together with shared interactions and input building towards a common goal.

---

# Collaboration

* Multiple types of collaboration
* Monitoring for single points of failure
* Monitoring burnout

## Framing Devops Narrative

---


# The Devops Compact

* shared mutual understanding
* established boundaries

# Team

* Common purpose
* Defined beliefs
* Empowered

---

# Diversity in Teams

* Professional
* Personal
* Goals
* Cognitive Styles

---

# Team Activity 2
### Careless Conversations (inspired by Alan Cyment)

* Pair up
* Select one person to go first.
* For one minute, speaker talks about something passionate about. Listener stays seated, quiet, and acts disinterested.
* Switch roles and repeat.
* Repeat until both people have done this twice.

Time: 5 minutes

![fit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kdaniels/effective-devops/master/images/timer.png)

---

## Careless Conversations

* How does it feel not to be listened to?
* How does it feel to ignore someone?

---

## Cultivating Empathy

* Collect stories
* Listen
* Circle back

^ this is how you transform a group into a team

---

# Shared stories
## articulate values and ideas.

---

# Shared stories
## explain historical significance.

# Shared stories
## passing knowledge

---

# Shared stories
## influence community.

---

# Shared stories
## cultivate empathy.

---

> A life becomes meaningful when one sees himself or herself as an actor within the context of a story.

-- George Howard

^ Work is meaningful when people see themselves as active participants. Sharing story is critical part of building resilience.

---

# Mindsets 

* Fixed
* Growth

---

# Small vs Large teams

* Large teams - roles may be highly segregated
* Small teams - one person may be responsible for many roles

---

# Critical Habits for Teams

* Code Review
* Pairing

---

# Code Review

* Max 90 minutes in one setting

---

# Pairing

* Agile software development
* 2 people work together on 1 workstation
* Driver - writes code
* Observer - reviews each line
* Roles switch frequently

---

# Types of Pairing

* Expert-expert
* Expert-novice
* Novice-novice



^ When experts pair, work gets done quickly, new innovation not always obtained, depending on skill overlap because not questioning accepted standards of doing things.

^ When expert and novice pair, can be very good or very bad. if expert isn't patient and does all the typing, novice learns helplessness and slow to get anything done. if expert is patient can involve growth for both as novice helps expert to question standards.

^ When novices pair, can work together to learn and achieve more than a novice working on their own. If no understanding in pair, and fire-fighting schedules can lead to poor practices implemented into production higher technical debt.

# Team Activity 2.5: Coat of Arms

---

# Visualizing Work

* Break down rigid single points of knowledge failure
* Reduce Development friction
* Eliminate dupicate efforts

---

# A solution

* Team kanban board
* Commitments to incremental improvements

---

# Factors for Success

* management buy in
 * training
 * effort to minimize "pushing"
* weekly team syncs
* proximity of team

---

# Prepping for Success

* Environment
* Values
* Desire
* Motivation
* Connectedness

---

# Team versus Individual 

---

# Objectives

* Defined by the team. Not management.
* Defined by the team. Not individuals.
* Everyone has voice, opportunity to speak.

---

# As a team... 

* Discuss objectives.
* Describe work.
* Define lanes.
* Define a task.
* Define a project. 

---

# Elect a Champion

---

# Workflow

Work that is

* orchestrated
* repeatable
* organized
* moves from one state to another


---

# WIP

* Work in Progress
 * work that has had money or people applied to it.

---

# Work Identification

* name
* start date
* end date
* current state
* description
* priority
* owner

---

# Task Handling

* What is it?
* Can you do anything with it?
* What is the next step?

---

# Projects

* Same requirements as a task
* Larger in scope
* May be comprised of more than one task

---

# Interrupts

* Non planned work that comes in
 * customer request
 * incident
 * request for help from coworker
 * single point of knowledge (you) work
 * high priority task push from manager



---

# Blocked work

* Work that can progress no further:
 * dependent teams - blocked by external team
 * insufficiently qualified request - blocked by requester
 * dependent on SPOK - blocked by team
 * time dependent

---

# Team Activity 3

Discuss with your team:

* What is the difference between a task and a project?
* Do you have interrupts? What are they?
* How do you determine when work is done?

Time: 15 minutes

![fit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kdaniels/effective-devops/master/images/timer.png)

---

# Kanban is a system.

* Visual process management
 * what to do
 * when to do it
 * how much to do

---

# Kanban is a method.

* incremental, evolutionary process improvement

---

# 3 principles

* Current Process
* Incremental, evolutionary change
* Respect

---

# Current Process

* Do you know what the current process is?
* Is it documented? Is it explicit? Is it clear?
* Has it been evaluated with the team?

---

# Incremental Evolutionary Change

* How are you measuring current process?
* Is the value clearly understood?
 * Is work defined in value or cost?

---

# Respect

* Find the current value.
* Not forceful in nature.
* What people want versus how to get there

---

# Kanban

* Start with what you do now
* Agree to incremental, evolutionary change
* Respect
* Everyone is a leader

^ Model what you're currently doing: how does work get done, what states do things get into, how do things get blocked
^ Everyone on the team is empowered to pull things, to suggest change, to create their stories

---

# Kanban Practices

* Visualize
* Limit WIP
* Manage flow
* Make policies explicit
* Implement feedback loops



---

# Visualize

* Intent
* Alignment
* Coherence


---

# Limit WIP

* Pull (don't push)


---

# Manage Flow

* Monitor/measure/report
* Incremental change



---

# Make Policies Explicit

* Document processes
* Group signoff



---

# Implement Feedback Loops

* Collaboration
* Retrospectives



---

# Team Activity 4

Talk through workflow for tasks for your team. How will you figure out what work needs to be done, who will work on the work, and when it is done. Use postits to mock up a legend for types of work items. Use pad to mock up your work items board. Use blue tape to mark off lanes. 

Time: 30 minutes

# Team Activity 5

In pairs, discuss your current work environment. 

* Who are the members of your team (at work)?
* Who are the people who have commit access?
* What's the flow of code from design to deploy?

While one person shares their environment, the other person should draw a diagram to represent the information shared. Use circles to represent people, triangles to represent code repos, and rectangles to represent infrastructure. Use arrows to represent relationships and flow.

# Intro to Jenkins

* continuous integration server to build and test software.
* integrated with source control (svn, git, ..)
* integration with build systems
* worker nodes to scale out systems
* plugins (complex and community maintained)

---

# Layers of Infrastructure Management

* Orchestration 
 * Coordination
 * Scheduling
* Configuration packages and software
* Provisioning

---

# Jenkins terminology

* job - base unit of work. 

---

# General workflow

* source control change 
* jenkins polls source control, triggers a build
* job runs, reports failure or success

---

# Difference between jenkins and chef

* jenkins generally for build and test
* chef for automation of configuration, node deploy to comply to policy

Jenkins can deploy! Jenkins as coordinators.
